### Adding new Icons

When adding new icons keep these steps in mind;

* Add the new SVG file to the correct folder under `./svg/<Category>`
* You do not need to edit `unicodeMap.json` unless it needs a specific Unicode, this will be auto generated in the build step
* Ensure the icon has  a height of 512 and a maximum width of 512 (may be thinner)
* Each SVG must have ONLY 1 path - multiple paths will be combined into one.
* Use the `non-zero` method for creating hollowed out inserts (for example 1-square.svg), _**DO NOT**_ use `even-odd`. 
* Run the conversion script to clean up the icon formats; `npm run convert ./file/glob/**/*.svg`
* Run `npm run build` to generate the font files and js files
* Run `npm run build:images` to generate the icon screenshots used in this readme, please doublecheck this image to make sure your icons were added successfully.

#### FontAwesome Duotone Note

Currently we do not support the creation of Duotone icons until FontAwesome completes it's implementation. Specifically their [React Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react) implementation.

### Disclaimer

TableCheck Icons are an original creation. However, [some icons may resemble designs found elsewhere
on the internets](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ThereIsOnlyOneCloudIconInTheEntireUniverse.aspx),
including variations of icons in [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
If we've done something daft please raise an issue and we'll discuss in a civil manner.

**To Font Awesome:** If you'd like to take icons from our set and add them to FontAwesome,
we're all for it, please get in touch.
